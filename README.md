# Line of Sight

**Line of Sight** is an application designed to provide visual guidance and environmental context to visually-impaired people using advanced AI. The app integrates OpenStreetMap's Overpass API for local POI discovery, Google's Gemini API for real-time image analysis and conversational text generation, and Fish Audio's API for natural text-to-speech audio output.

## Features

*   **Real-time Object Detection**: Uses YOLOv8 to detect objects and identify potential hazards.
*   **Environmental Description**: Captures scenes and uses Google's Gemini AI Model to describe the surroundings in conversational text.
*   **POI Discovery**: Identifies nearby Points of Interest (POIs) using OpenStreetMap data and uses Google's Gemini AI Model to describe the POIs in conversational text.
*   **Audio Guidance**: Converts visual and location conversational text into audio using Fish Audio's API.
*   **Safety Alerts**: Prioritizes critical danger warnings over other audio descriptions.
